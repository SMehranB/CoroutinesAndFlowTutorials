/**
 * ðŸ”¥runBlocking
 * Runs a new coroutine and blocks the current thread interruptibly until its completion. This function should not be used from a coroutine.
 * ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±runBlocking is almost never a tool you use in production, because It undoes the asynchronous, non-blocking nature of coroutines.
 * You can use it if you happen to already have some coroutine-based code that you want to use in a context where coroutines provide no value: in blocking calls.
 * There are 2 typical use case for runBlocking :
 * 1 -  JUnit testing, where the test method must just sit and wait for the coroutine to complete.
 * 2 - Play around with coroutines, inside your main method.
 *
 * ðŸ”¥ CoroutineDispatcher
 * CoroutineDispatcher determines what thread or threads the corresponding coroutine uses for its execution.
 *
 * ðŸ”¥ CoroutineContext includes a coroutine dispatcher
 * The coroutine context includes a coroutine dispatcher (see CoroutineDispatcher) that determines what thread or threads the corresponding coroutine uses for its execution.
 * The coroutine dispatcher can confine coroutine execution to a specific thread, dispatch it to a thread pool, or let it run unconfined.
 *
 * ðŸ”¥ launch { }
 * fun CoroutineScope.launch(
 *                           context: CoroutineContext = EmptyCoroutineContext,
 *                           start: CoroutineStart = CoroutineStart.DEFAULT,
 *                           block: suspend CoroutineScope.() -> Unit
 *                           ): Job (source)
 *
 * Launches a new coroutine without blocking the current thread and returns a reference to the coroutine as a Job. The coroutine is cancelled when the resulting job is cancelled.
 * The coroutine context is inherited from a CoroutineScope. Additional context elements can be specified with context argument.
 *
 * All coroutine builders like launch and async accept an optional CoroutineContext parameter that can be used to explicitly specify the dispatcher for the new coroutine and other context elements.
 * When launch { ... } is used without parameters, it inherits the context (and thus dispatcher) from the CoroutineScope it is being launched from.
 * In this case, it inherits the context of the main runBlocking coroutine which runs in the main thread.
