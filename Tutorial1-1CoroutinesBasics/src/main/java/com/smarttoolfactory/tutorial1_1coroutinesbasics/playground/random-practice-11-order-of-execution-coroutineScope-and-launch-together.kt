/*
* Clone of coroutineScope-1.kt
*
* üî• launch returns immediately but inside of launch not eecuted immediately. non-blocking code after launch is executed firstly, then inside of launch is executed.
* üê≤ coroutineScope is a blocking code. Code execution does not go to following line,
* waits for completion of inside of coroutineScope and coroutines started before coroutineScope. Thus printed 3 1 2.
