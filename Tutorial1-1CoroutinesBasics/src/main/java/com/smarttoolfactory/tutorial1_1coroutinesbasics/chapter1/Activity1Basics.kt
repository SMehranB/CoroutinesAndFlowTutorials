/**
 * * **Coroutine context**
 * The coroutine context is a set of rules and configurations that define how the coroutine will be executed.
 * Under the hood, itâ€™s a kind of map, with a set of possible keys and values.
 *
 * For now, itâ€™s just enough for you to know that one of the possible configurations
 * is the dispatcher that is used to identify the thread where the coroutine will be executed.
 *
 * This dispatcher can be provided in two ways:
 * **Explicitly**: we manually set the dispatcher that will be used
 * **By the coroutine scope**: letâ€™s forget about scopes for now, but this would be the second option
 *
 * * **withContext**
 * This is a function that allows to easily change the context that will be used
 * to run a part of the code inside a coroutine.
 * This is a suspending function, so it means that itâ€™ll suspend the coroutine
 * until the code inside is executed, no matter the dispatcher that itâ€™s used.
 *
 * * **Dispatchers**
 * **Dispatchers.Default**: CPU-intensive work, such as sorting large lists,
 * doing complex calculations and similar. A shared pool of threads on the JVM backs it.
 *
 * **Dispatchers.IO**: networking or reading and writing from files.
 * In short â€“ any input and output, as the name states
 *
 * **Dispatchers.Main**: recommended dispatcher for performing UI-related events.
 * For example, showing lists in a RecyclerView, updating Views and so on.

/*
    Dispatchers
    Dispatchers are coroutine contexts that specify the thread or threads that can be used by
    the coroutine to run its code. There are dispatchers that just use one thread (like Main)
    and others that define a pool of threads that will be optimized to run all the coroutines they receive.


    We have four main dispatchers:

    ðŸ”¥ Default: It will be used when no dispatcher is defined, but we can set it explicitly too.
    This dispatcher is used to run tasks that make intensive
    use of the CPU, mainly App computations, algorithms, etc.
    It can use as many threads as CPU cores. As these are intensive tasks,
     it doesnâ€™t make sense to have more running at the same time, because the CPU will be busy

    ðŸ”¥ IO: You will use this one to run input/output operations. In general, all tasks that
    will block the thread while waiting for an answer from another system:
    server requests, access to database, files, sensorsâ€¦
    As they donâ€™t use the CPU, you can have many running at the same time,
    so the size of this thread pool is 64. Android Apps are all about
    interaction with the device and network requests,
    so you probably will use this one most of the time.

    ðŸ”¥ Unconfined: if you donâ€™t care much what thread is used, you can use this one.
    Itâ€™s difficult to predict what thread will be used,
    so donâ€™t use it unless youâ€™re very sure of what youâ€™re doing

    ðŸ”¥Main: this is a special dispatcher that is included in UI related coroutine libraries.
    In particular, in the Android one, it will use the UI thread.

 */

/*
    ðŸ”¥ launch: The exception propagates to the parent and will fail your coroutine
    parent-child hierarchy. This will throw an exception in the coroutine thread immediately.
    You can avoid these exceptions with try/catch blocks, or a custom exception handler.

    ðŸ”¥ async: You defer exceptions until you consume the result for the async block.
    That means if you forgot or did not consume the result of the async block, through await(),
     you may not get an exception at all! The coroutine will bury it, and your app will be fine.
     If you want to avoid exceptions from await(),
     use a try/catch block either on the await() call, or within async().
